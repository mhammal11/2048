# 2048
A terminal-based simple implementation of the popular game 2048 written in Java

At the start of each game, the board starts
with two numbered tiles (either 2 or 4) placed randomly around the board. The user
can make moves (up, down, left, right) to shift the tiles in the board. Whenever a move
occurs, adjacent tiles with the same value that can be merged together will be combined
and a new random tile will be generated to occupy one of the empty tiles in the board.
The game is won when the tile 2048 is found and the game is lost when the board is
full and no more possible moves can be made. 

The game can be launched and played by
typing `make start` in terminal.
